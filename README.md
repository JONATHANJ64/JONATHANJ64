## 🚀 About Me

I build production backend systems, infrastructure validation platforms, and AI-enabled automation tooling.

My work spans distributed cloud services (AWS), event-driven orchestration, CI-driven release gating, and embedded/industrial validation environments. I focus heavily on correctness, deployment safety, observability, and reducing operational friction through structured automation.

Core themes in my work:

- Event-driven backend architecture
- Infrastructure-as-code validation
- CI/CD release gating
- System-level test planning & validation
- AI-assisted developer tooling (LLM + human-in-the-loop systems)
- Production reliability and incident response
